# pong
My first game.
Pong is one of the first computer games that ever created, this simple "tennis like" game features two paddles and a ball, the goal is to defeat your opponent. The game can be played with two human players, or one player against a computer controlled paddle. The game was originally developed by Allan Alcorn and released in 1972 by Atari corporations.
